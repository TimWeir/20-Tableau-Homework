I selected data from January through December 2014 and uncovered the following phenomena in this file

1.  In 2014, total Citibike ridership topped 7 million but less than one quareter was attributed to female riders
2.  Furthermore, almost every single recorded rider was a subscriber rather than customer.
3.  Zip code 10011 showed the greatest popularity with approximately 11% of total ridership in the city.
4.  8th Ave & W 31st was the dominant starting point along with almost 96,000 riders
5.  Lafayette St & E 8th St took the top spot as the most desirable desitnation (almost 80,000 riders).
